 On this page, you will find some articles on certain topics in sound design and audio engineering. 
 I wrote those articles, because i believe that a solid understanding of the underlying principles 
 of sound and music is a major benefit when using audio processing software. I wrote the articles 
 in the style of short memos, each on one topic at a time and I hope, those memos will give the 
 reader insights which enable them to use audio software more successfully in order to create 
 better music.
