<h3>XMLBatchProcessor</h3>
<p>
 XMLBatchProcessor is a tool which lets you process a bunch of .xml file at once. The 'process' 
 can be to replace a string with another string or convert values of numeric attributes by applying
 a conversion formula to them. This tool may come in handy, when for some reason you want to or 
 have to change a bunch of preset files for one of the RS-MET products. An example scenario could
 be: you have created a bunch of patches for Straightliner using your own .wav files as oscillator 
 waveforms. These patches will have stored the relative paths of these wavefiles. Now you realize 
 that the synth supports .flac and you want to replace those .wav files with their .flac 
 counterparts. So you do. But in order for your patches to still work, you must now change the 
 stored filenames in all those .xml files - no problem: invoke the XMLBatchProcessor, browse to 
 your patch directory, set the program up to replace .wav with .flac and let it do its work. Of 
 course, there might be completely different scenarios which are not necessarily related to patches 
 for RS-MET products at all.
</p>

<p>
 DISCLAIMER: This program will irreversibly change the content of a whole bunch of files - you use 
 it at your own risk. Although there is a mechanism to automatically create a backup of the old 
 files (they will be zipped to an archive before applying the processing), don't rely on this for 
 sensitive data and use this tool with care.

 RSPlot is a mathematical curve and function plotting application. It supports plotting of single 
 curves or functions, parametrized curve/function families and plotting  of several unrelated 
 curves/functions in one single plot. The result can be exported to an .svg vector graphics file 
 or to a .png bitmap graphics file.

<h3>DSP Papers and Notes</h3>
<p>
 In this section, I publish some papers and notes on various DSP related topics. In this context, 
 I say "paper" to refer to a somewhat finished document, whereas a "note" may be just a collection 
 of ideas that I quickly wrote down for later reference. These documents arise during development 
 phases in which I familiarize myself with algorithms or derive algorithms myself. For the content 
 of the documents, the same "as-is" and "no-warranties" considerations as for the software apply. 
 If you find errors, I'd be grateful, if you could notify me.

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/DefiniteIntegrationOfPolynomialsWithPolynomialsAsLimits.pdf">Definite Integration of Polynomials with Polynomials as Limits</a><br>
 I derive an algorithm to calculate coefficients for a polynomial that is given as a definite integral over some other polynomial, where the intergration limits are also given as polynomials.
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/GeneralizedHadamardTransform.pdf">A Generalization of the Hadamard Transform</a><br>
 I describe a generalization of the Hadamard transform that may be useful as feedback matrix in a feedback delay network (FDN).
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/TwoInterpretationsOfFrequencyWarpedTransferFunctions.pdf">
  Two Interpretations Of Frequency Warped Transfer Functions
 </a><br>
 Referring to the z-domain frequency transformations proposed by Constantinides, I present two 
 different ways to view and actually implement them.
</p> 

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/ResonanceTuningForTheDigitalMoogFilter.pdf">
 Resonance Tuning For The Digital Moog Filter
 </a><br>
 A paper in which I derive formulas for correct tuning of the resonance frequency and feedback 
 gain for a digital model of the famous Moog filter.
</p> 
 
<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/AttackDecayEnvelope.pdf">Attack Decay Envelope</a><br>
 Derives equations for scaling the impulse response of a series connection of two RC-type filters so 
 as to achieve a peak amplitude of unity. This scaling is useful if one wants to use such a series 
 connection as envelope generator.
</p>  

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/TwoPointHermiteInterpolation.pdf">
 Hermite Interpolation Between 2 Points
 </a><br>
 Gives formulas for the coefficients of a polynomial that goes through 2 sample points and matches
 a number of prescribed derivatives at these points.
</p>  

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/LowShelvingPrototypes.pdf">
  Low Shelving Analog Prototype Filters
 </a><br>
 In this paper, I describe how to transform an arbitrary analog lowpass prototype filter into a 
 low-shelving prototype.
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/BluesteinFFT.pdf">Bluestein FFT</a><br>
 Here, I present the derivation of the Bluestein FFT algorithm and try to give an intuitive 
 interpretation of the result. The Bluestein FFT algorithm is an O(N * log(N)) algorithm to compute
 the DFT of a sequence of arbitrary length.
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/TimeDomainBiquadDesign.pdf">Time Domain Biquad Design</a><br>
 I derive formulas for designing biquad filters from time-domain specifications of the desired 
 impulse response, such as frequency, amplitude, phase and decay of a deacying sinusoid.
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/ContinuousTimeSystems.pdf">Continuous Time Systems</a><br>
 A summary of my current understanding of linear time-invariant systems in continuous time. Explains
 the differential equation, transfer function and frequency response (still somewhat incomplete).
</p>

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/BasicDigitalFilters.pdf">Basic Digital Filters</a><br>
 A collection of some formulas for basic digital filters.
</p> 
 
<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/Formantanalyse.pdf">Formantanalyse</a><br>
 A document that I wrote as a seminar paper during my studies. It's about linear prediction, 
 adaptive filters and the Levinson/Durbin algorithm. Written in german language.
</p> 

<p>
 <a class="document" href="documents/dsp/Magisterarbeit.pdf">Thesis</a><br>
 This is my master thesis. It's about spectral envelopes and modeling of formants. Written in 
 german language.
</p>

<h3>Open Source Stuff</h3>
<p> 
 <a class="download" href="open_source/BesselFilterDesign.zip">BesselFilterDesign.zip</a><br>
 A toolbox for GNU Octave and MatLab to design analog and digital Bessel filters. It also 
 incorporates Bessel based shelving- and peaking-characteristics, implementing the algorithm 
 described in the LowShelvingPrototypes.pdf paper above.
