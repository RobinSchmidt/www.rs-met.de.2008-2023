<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>
 If you purchase a commercial RS-MET product, you will get a personalized keyfile which contains your name, physical address and email address (which I obtain from the PayPal purchase notification). I keep a copy of this keyfile on my local computer in order to later verify a purchase, if you should loose you keyfile and need a new one. I also archive the PayPal purchase notifications for accounting purposes (in accordance with german tax laws). 

<p>
 If you subscribe to the email newsletter, your email address will be stored in a mailing list and deleted from the list when you unsubscribe.
  
<p>
 If you contact me via email, I sometimes archive the conversation for later reference.
 
<p>
 When you visit the RS-MET website, my webhosting provider (strato.de) keeps the usual server logfiles containing your IP address, browser, operating system, location, date and time of server request.
 
<p> 
 The only person who has access to the data is me (Robin) and my webhosting provider. I don't share any of that data with anyone. The website doesn't use cookies or google analytics or any other analysis tool.

    The company was founded in August 2008 by Robin Schmidt (that's me) and started sales of its 
	first commercial product - the subtractive synthesizer 'Straightliner' - at this point. My 
	educational background is a master degree in communication science (with focus on audio signal 
	processing), computer science (with focus on artificial intelligence / neural networks) and 
	acoustics. The certificate and thesis can be seen 
	<a class="download" href="documents/certificates/MasterCertificateAndThesis.zip">here</a> (in 
	german). My personal background is being a passionate music- and sound-design freak with 
	several years of VST-development in the freeware department. This old stuff is still available 
	on my private website www.braindoc.de but is discontinued in this form. However, certain things 
	will be continued in the context of this company.

<h3>The company policy</h3>

<h4>Target Group</h4>
<p>
 RS-MET is targeting mainly at those musicians and audio engineers who really want to know, what 
 they are doing when tweaking some parameter - thus, the more technically inclined. That's why 
 parameters are always shown in meaningful physical units (for example in Hz for frequencies, dB 
 for levels, etc.) rather than as arbitrary number between 0 and 10 or 0 and 127 or without any 
 numerical display at all. The overall look and feel of the plugins may come across rather clean 
 and technical. But that should not in any way sacrifice the fun-factor. Signal-processing wise, 
 there's more rock'n'roll in the plugIns than the somewhat clean interfaces may suggest. A bit 
 like throwing an electric guitar into a drumset but calculating its parabolic trajectory before.
</p>

<h4>User Interfaces</h4>
<p>
 On the one hand, I try to make them as simple as possible (but no simpler ;-) ), but on the other
 hand, I want to give the user deep editing capabilities. These are actually two conflicting
 requirements. That's why I always try to focus on the clarity, leaving out all the fancy bells and
 whistles commonly seen on artwork-ish designed user interfaces. Also, I do believe that software
 user-interfaces can have an inherent advantage over hardware interfaces because they can easily
 visualize what's going on. So I try to exploit this (potential) advantage as much as possible by
 incorporating visual editors wherever this is possible and meaningful. I think that this advantage
 can often outweigh the inherent disadvantage of software compared to hardware of having no 
 physical presence. I don't see any point in mimicking the look-and-feel of hardware on the screen 
 (with all those virtual knobs, virtual wood panels, rack mounts, etc.) because that would often 
 mean to relinquish the potential advantage (without getting back the physical presence of 
 hardware, of course) - screen estate can be used more meaningfully than for virtual rack mounts.
</p>

<h4>Licensing and Copy-Protection</h4>
<p>
 For the commercial products, I can't get around the necessary evil to implement some licensing 
 mechanism (although I find that boring and distracting). Because I'm much more interested in 
 audio signal processing than in copy protection mechanisms, I want to keep that as simple as 
 possible. rs-met uses a simple keyfile mechanism - that is: you can download all products here 
 from this website, but the commercial ones will run in demo mode unless you have a keyfile in the 
 same folder as the plugIn. Each such keyfile is unique and it is probably needless to say that it 
 is a violation of the licensing agreement to share such keyfiles. You can obtain (buy, that is) 
 such keyfiles through the online payment service PayPal on the Products page.  Once you have it, 
 simply put it side by side into the same directory in which the actual program/plugIn resides and 
 from now on you will not be nagged by the demo restrictions anymore.
</p>

<h4>Marketing</h4>
<p>
 Factual person that I am, it sometimes annoys me a bit when audio software companies are boasting 
 marketing phrases like '...our innovative groundbreaking next generation super high quality audio 
 engine will give you the most pristine sound quality ever in the universe...' (a bit exaggerated, 
 admittedly). Instead of throwing around such phrases, I try to give well founded technical 
 information and facts about the underlying signal processing algorithms. That reflects the aim to 
 target the more technically inclined musicians, producers and audio engineers who are not so 
 easily glared. I believe that this type of user is better attracted by true information - that's 
 a reason why I provide tutorials which explain what certain effect- and synthesis-algorithms do, 
 why they do it, and - to some extent - how they do it.
