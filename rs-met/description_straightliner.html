    Straightliner is a straight-lined and modern approach to subtractive synthesis. Instead of 
	trying to faithfully emulate old analog synthesizers with all their physically imposed 
	limitations, Straightliner takes full advantage of the extended possibilities that software 
	based synthesis offers: the oscillators support loading of arbitrary (single cycle) audio 
	files. Flexible modulation generators, which allow to define an arbitrary number of 
	breakpoints, are available for pitch, filter-frequency and amplitude. The filter has a lot of 
	different modes, among them the usual suspects like lowpass, highpass, bandpass and a 
	sophisticated Moog-filter model. The whole signal path is laid out in stereo which allows for 
	big and enveloping sounds even without any effects. The user interface of the synth focuses on 
	visual editors instead of the commonly seen hardware oriented interfaces.

<h3>Demo Clips</h3>
<p>
 ...all well and good, but by far the most important aspect of a synthesizer is its sound, of 
 course. I produced some democlips which were created by Straightliner only, playing one patch at 
 a time without any post-processing. You may verify this yourself by reconstructing the demos with 
 the 
 <a class="download" href="democlips/straightliner/StraightlinerDemoClipReconstructionPack.zip">
 StraightlinerDemoClipReconstructionPack.zip</a>. It comprises the required MIDI files which you 
 may import into you favourite DAW, then route the MIDI-track to Straightliner and load the 
 appropriate patch into the synth. Most patches are factory-presets and in the other cases, the 
 patch-file is also included in the reconstruction pack. 
</p>

<p>
 Let's start with some cliche-sounds - although Straightliner does not really define itself as 
 virtual analog, it can convincingly deliver that type of sound - here are a few examples of 
 Straightliner doing some typical dance/trance stuff:<br>
 <a class="audio" href="democlips/straightliner/002-SuperSaw1.mp3">002-SuperSaw1.mp3</a><br>
 <a class="audio" href="democlips/straightliner/TranceStabs.mp3">TranceStabs.mp3</a><br>
</p>

<p>
 The multistage envelope generators can be used to create gated/patternized sounds:<br>

 <a class="audio" href="democlips/straightliner/TrancyPattern.mp3">TrancyPattern.mp3</a><br>
</p> 
 
<p>
 O.K. 'nuff trance-stuff - what else is there? Another popular and often requested sound is that 
 squelchy acid bass as pioneered by Roland's famous TB-303. Here's Straightliner's interpretation 
 of that kind of sound:<br>
 <a class="audio" href="democlips/straightliner/004-AcidPulse.mp3">004-AcidPulse.mp3</a><br>
</p> 

<p>
 how about a little bit of 1980's-Pop flavour:<br>

 after all the (in my humble opinion, well deserved) hype around supersaws, hypersaws and 
 whateversaws, what's next? Straightliner, with its four stereo-detunable oscillators (which 
 essentially establish eight oscillators due to the stereo detune), can turn any waveform or any 
 combination of up to four waveforms into a 'superwave'. Using a waveform which itself consists of 
 a bunch of sawtooths at various octaves, i made a sound that i called MegaGigaTeraSaw - with a 
 grain of irony, obviously:<br>

</p>

<p>
 virtually every musical genre needs bass-sounds, so let's see how Straightliner performs in that 
 realm:<br>
 <a class="audio" href="democlips/straightliner/VariousBasses.mp3">VariousBasses.mp3</a><br>
</p>

<p>
 pad- and filler sounds are also an important ingredient to many styles - here are some smooth 
 pad-sounds and a not so smooth drone:<br>

 ah, and who said that subtractive synthesis is good only for 'virtual analog' sounds? Let's hear 
 some virtual acoustic sounds:<br>

 i saved the best for the last - to present a piano-patch there's probably no better way than 
 Beethoven's masterpiece 'Fuer Elise'. Because i'm a crap piano/keyboard player myself, i took 
 some free MIDI file from the web. Unfortunately, i don't have any background info for this file, 
 so if you are the performer and feel it is inappropriate to use it here, simply drop me an email. 
 With all respect to the unknown performer (and to the composer as well, of course), here's the 
 whole piece in full length - lean back, relax and enjoy:<br>

<h3>Download Demo</h3>
<p>
 Download a demo version of Straightliner here:
 <a class="download" href="software/products/Straightliner_v10.03.zip">
  Download Straightliner (Windows/VST)</a>
</p> 

<!-- TODO: use a server-side include for the demo-restrictions: -->
<p>The demo version has the following restrictions:</p> 
<ul>
 <li>after 20 minutes of use, the output will be muted - you need to reload the plugin to get sound 
     out of it again</li>
 <li>restoring of the state of the plugin's parameters by the host (also known as 'total recall') 
     is disabled (but the internal preset management is fully functional)</li>
 <li>you are not allowed to use the demo version inside a commercial production where as 'commercial 
     production' qualifies everything, you make money out of</li>
</ul>

<p>
 To keep the download size of the synth small, the archive above contains only those waveforms that 
 are required to load the presets and a few more. A more comprehensive library of waveforms 
 (several thousands of them) can be downloaded here: 
 <a class="download" href="sounds/samples/CyclePack.zip">CyclePack.zip</a>. These are all single 
 cycle waveforms which were either created by myself or taken from resources that were released 
 under the <a class="external" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0" 
 target="_blank">Creative Commons License</a>. The whole pack is released under this license as 
 well. To use these waveforms, drop the archive into Straightliner's Samples folder (which should 
 sit in the same directory as the .dll) and extract the archive directly there (right-click -> 
 extract here).
</p>

<h3>Purchase License</h3>
<p>
 To turn the demo version into a full version, you will need to purchase a license file. The price 
 for the license is 89 Euro. To proceed to the end user license agreement and purchase a license
