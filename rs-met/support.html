<h3>Newsletter</h3>

<p>
 To subscribe or unsubscribe to/from the RS-MET newsletter, please enter your email address in the 
 following field and click 'OK':
</p> 

<form action="mailto:news@rs-met.com" method=post enctype="text/plain">
 <input type=radio name=what value="subscribe" checked>Subscribe
 <input type=radio name=what value="subscribe">Unsubscribe
 <input type=checkbox name=pressReleasesOnly value="PressReleasesOnly">Press releases only 
 <br><br>
 <input type=text name=address size=52>
 <input type=submit value="OK">
</form>

<p>
 No spam, please! 
 <br>
 There's a fine line between useful product information and outright spam. Therefore, this 
 newsletter follows a well defined policy: it will be sent out whenever a new (free or 
 commercial) product or update of some existing product is released. In addition, a kind of 'last 
 call reminder' will be sent out 3 days before special offers expire (RS-MET gives introductory 
 offers for new products). Thus, the traffic is roughly equivalent to the news section displayed 
 on the start-page. If you check the 'Press releases only' checkbox, the traffic will be even 
 lower - you will receive only those news that are important enough for a press-release, which 
 are typically releases of new commercial products and major updates for them. That's it and you 
 can at any time unsubscribe by using the above form or sending a mail to news@rs-met.com with 
 subject "Unsubscribe". Needless to say that your email address will be treated strictly 
 confidential, of course.
