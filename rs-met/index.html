   <p>
    On this page, you will find a range of plugins that are offered as freeware. In the development 
	of these freebies, the same high quality standards as for the commercial products apply - the 
	only difference between free and commercial products is the complexity of the feature set.

   <p>
    RS-MET currently offers two commercial products: the subtractive virtual synthesizer 
	'Straightliner' and the sophisticated delay plugin 'EchoLab'. To purchase a product, you just 
	buy a keyfile via PayPal and put it into the same directory where the plugin resides. The next 
	time the plugin is loaded, it will recognize the keyfile and switch from demo-mode into 
	unrestricted mode.

   <p>
    This page contains tutorials on various audio effects and sound synthesis techniques and how to 
    use them. Although some of these tutorials may contain references to RS-MET products, they are 
    written in a way so as to be generally applicable and useful.

 Welcome to Robin Schmidt's Music Engineering Tools. On this site, you will find high-precision 
 software tools for sound-synthesis, and music production. The software comes in the form 
 of plugins for the VST interface (VST is a trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH) on the 
 MS Windows platform. RS-MET aims to satisfy the musician's desire for good sounding instruments 
 and effects with intuitive access to musically relevant parameters as well as the audio 
 engineer's (additional) desire for precise control and accurate visual presentation.
