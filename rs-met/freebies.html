	ToolChain is a plugin that is actually many plugins in one. It acts as a shell which lets
	you set up a chain of effects, one processed after another in a series connection. You can also
	put instruments at the front of the chain. At some point, i was just tired of maintaining a 
	separate project for each of my plugins, so i lumped them all into one. The download archive 
	contains a Windows VST x64 version, a Mac AU version, a support folder containing presets, 
	sample-content, etc. and a textfile with manual installation instructions.

 For legacy reasons, the older versions of the plugins which are now supposed to be replaced by 
 ToolChain are still available below. At the moment, not yet all of them are integrated into 
 ToolChain, but this is what is going to happen soon. Also, the older plugins may still be needed, 
 if you are using a 32-Bit (x86) host.

    EasyQ is an easy-to-use equalizer with an arbitrary number of filter stages in series 
    connection. Each of the filter stages can operate in one of the following modes: 
    peak/cut (aka bell or parametric EQ), high- or low-shelving, notch and low- or highpass (both 
    with either 6 or 12 dB/oct slope). EasyQ is also easy on the CPU and just does what an EQ is 
    supposed to do without performing any additional voodoo. As such, it is well suited to serve as 
    a go-to EQ for the routine equalizing tasks.

    CrossOver is a plugin to split an incoming signal into several (at most 4) frequency ranges. 
	It can be used to build your own multiband effects within a modular (sub)host environment. 
	By using only 2 bands, you can also create bass-effects. These are effects which keep the low 
	frequency range dry and affect only the high frequency range. The band-splitting is done by 
	complementary pairs of Linkwitz-Riley lowpass/highpass filters, the slope of which is 
	adjustable between 12 and 96 dB/oct. For configurations with more than 2 output bands, the 
	signal is first split into 2 bands (low and high) and then the low or high or both bands is/are 
	split further, thus the splitting is done in a hierarchical manner.

    EngineersFilter is a filter plugin that allows for extremely steep filtering. It achieves this

	engineering, namely Butterworth, Chebychev, inverse Chebychev, elliptic (aka Cauer), Bessel and 
	Papoulis filters. Each of these filter design methods can be applied to create lowpass, 
	highpass, bandpass, bandreject, high/low shelving and peak/dip filters of orders up to 20.

    Pitch Shifter is a plugIn to shift the pitch of an incoming audio signal. By mixing the 
    pitch-shifted signal with the original signal via the dry/wet control, basic detuning, 
    octaving and harmonizing effects are also possible. This shifter is based on a delayline with 
    two crossfaded read pointers. Such an architecture allows for feedback - and feedback gives the 
    potential to rather drastic, weird special effects like monster-voices, flanger-like effects 
	and more.

    MIDI Monitor is a plugin which shows you the incoming MIDI messages. Because some hosts treat

	a slot of a different kind), there is an 'instrument' and an 'effect' version of the plugin to 
	make it pluggable everywhere. The MIDI-events are passed through unchanged, the same holds for 
	any incoming audio signal.
